# PSAppDeployToolkit.WinGet

## Synopsis

A PSAppDeployToolkit v4 extension module for WinGet.

## Description

This PowerShell module is a WinGet extension for PSAppDeployToolkit v4, allowing WinGet application installation and uninstallation via PSAppDeployToolkit.

## Why

More people ask for WinGet support in PSAppDeployToolkit than any other feature, so here's an implementation from one of PSAppDeployToolkit's very own developers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

From PowerShell, run `& .\actions_bootstrap.ps1` to install the required pre-requisites. This is only needed once.

### Building

From PowerShell, run `Invoke-Build -File .\src\PSAppDeployToolkit.WinGet.build.ps1`, which will compile this module (and your own if you use this project as your basis).

### Installation

From PowerShell, run `Install-Module -Name PSAppDeployToolkit.WinGet`, which will install the module, as well as PSAppDeployToolkit if you don't already have it.

### Quick start

#### Example #1

...coming soon!
